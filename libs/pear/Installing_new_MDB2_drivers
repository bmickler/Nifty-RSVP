How to install/upgrade new MDB2 drivers

1.  Download the driver package

Visit the PEAR repository to browse and select the driver that you want to 
install.  Download the archive package to your computer.  In this example I'm 
installing the MySQL MDB2 Driver version 1.5.0b2.


2.  Extract the archive

Extract the archived package.  You'll end up with a folder titled something like
'MDB2_Driver_mysql-1.5.0b2'


MDB2 Driver Package Structure
-----------------------------

The structure of the folder and it's contents should be similar to this:

./MDB2_Driver_<driver_name>-Version.x.x/
  |
  |-/MDB2_Driver_<driver_name>-Version.x.x/
  |    |
  |    |-/MDB2/
  |    |     |
  |    |     |-/Driver/
  |    |         |
  |    |         |-/Datatype/
  |    |         |    |
  |    |         |    |-<driver_name>.php
  |    |         |  
  |    |         |-/Function/
  |    |         |    |
  |    |         |    |-<driver_name>.php
  |    |         |  
  |    |         |-/Manager/
  |    |         |    |
  |    |         |    |-<driver_name>.php
  |    |         |  
  |    |         |-/Native/
  |    |         |    |
  |    |         |    |-<driver_name>.php
  |    |         |  
  |    |         |-/Reverse/
  |    |         |    |
  |    |         |    |-<driver_name>.php
  |    |         |
  |    |         |-<driver_name>.php
  |    |
  |    |-/tests/
  |    |    |
  |    |    |-MDB2_nonstandard_<driver_name>.php
  |    |
  |    |-package_<driver_name>.xml
  |
  |-package.xml


3.  Move files into their proper places

Some of the files and folders in the driver package will not be used.  The ones 
that we are concerned with are those that are located in the /Driver/ directory
and its' subdirectories.  First, let's look at the structure of this project's
integrated PEAR::MDB2 environment to see where these files are going to go:


Structure of the integrated PEAR::MDB2 library
----------------------------------------------
/[project root folder/
   |
   |-/libs/
       |
       |-/pear/
           |
           |-/MDB2/
           |   |
           |   |-/Driver/
           |   |    |
           |   |    |-/Datatype/
           |   |    |    |
           |   |    |    |-common.php
           |   |    |
           |   |    |-/Function/
           |   |    |    |
           |   |    |    |-common.php
           |   |    |
           |   |    |-/Manager/
           |   |    |    |
           |   |    |    |-common.php
           |   |    |
           |   |    |-/Native/
           |   |    |    |
           |   |    |    |-common.php
           |   |    |
           |   |    |-/Reverse/
           |   |         |
           |   |         |-common.php
           |   |
           |   |-Date.php
           |   |-Extended.php
           |   |-Iterator.php
           |   |-LOB.php
           |  
           |-/PEAR/
           |   |
           |   |-(a bunch of folders and files...)
           |
           |-index.html
           |-MDB2.php
           |-PEAR.php
           |-PEAR5.php

Basically, we're going to copy all of the files from the /Driver folder in the 
downloaded driver package over into the /Driver folder of the integraded 
PEAR::MDB2 install while keeping the location of each new driver file intact 
relative to the directory structure.

To start off, the main mysql.php driver file located in the /Driver folder of the 
archive should be moved to the local Driver folder.  Then move the mysql.php
file located in the /Datatype folder of the archive to the local /Datatype folder.
Continue until all files have been installed locally.  When you're done, the 
structure of the /MDB2 folder should look like this:

           |-/MDB2/
              |
              |-/Driver/
              |    |
              |    |-/Datatype/
              |    |    |
              |    |    |-common.php
              |    |    |-mysql.php
              |    |
              |    |-/Function/
              |    |    |
              |    |    |-common.php
              |    |    |-mysql.php
              |    |
              |    |-/Manager/
              |    |    |
              |    |    |-common.php
              |    |    |-mysql.php
              |    |
              |    |-/Native/
              |    |    |
              |    |    |-common.php
              |    |    |-mysql.php
              |    |
              |    |-/Reverse/
              |    |    |
              |    |    |-common.php
              |    |    |-mysql.php
              |    |
              |    |-mysql.php
              |
              |-Date.php
              |-Extended.php
              |-Iterator.php
              |-LOB.php


4.  Modify the new driver files to work with the local install

PEAR packages are designed to be installed onto your webserver in a folder that
is generally located outside of the web root.  The idea is that you'll install
PEAR and some PEAR packages and all of the web applications that you have running
will use the local PEAR installation on your webserver.  This application is
designed to include its' *own* local PEAR installation.  You can install this 
application on a webserver that does not have PEAR installed on it and it will
run just fine.  To make that work, we have to make a couple of really small 
modifications to the driver files.  Really, it's not a big deal.  Here we go:

The files that need to be modified are the new driver files that are located in
the /Datatype, /Function, /Manager, /Native, and /Reverse directories.  The main
driver file will be unaffected.  Basically, we're just going to add a 'require_once()'
call to each of the files so that it can reference the 'common.php' file that is
co-located in the same directory.

All changes are made at the top of the file around line 50 right before the class 
declaration.

file:           /Driver/Datatype/mysql.php
find:           require_once 'MDB2/Driver/Datatype/Common.php';
replace with:   require_once 'Common.php';

file:           /Driver/Function/mysql.php
find:           require_once 'MDB2/Driver/Function/Common.php';
replace with:   require_once 'Common.php';

file:           /Driver/Manager/mysql.php
find:           require_once 'MDB2/Driver/Manager/Common.php';
replace with:   require_once 'Common.php';

file:           /Driver/Native/mysql.php
find:           require_once 'MDB2/Driver/Native/Common.php';
replace with:   require_once 'Common.php';

file:           /Driver/Reverse/mysql.php
find:           require_once 'MDB2/Driver/Reverse/Common.php';
replace with:   require_once 'Common.php';


Also, the 'common.php' file located in the /Datatype folder has already been 
modified to be able to include the LOB.php file located up one directory.  This 
modification is at the top of the file:

line 47  //require_once 'MDB2/LOB.php';
line 48  require_once("../LOB.php");
